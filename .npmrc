# Configure how versions of packages installed to a package.json file
# via --save or --save-dev get prefixed.
# For example if a package has version 1.2.3, by default its version is set to
# ^1.2.3 which allows minor upgrades for that package, but after npm config set
# save-prefix='~' it would be set to ~1.2.3 which only allows patch upgrades.
save-prefix=~

# When publishing scoped packages, the access level defaults to restricted.
# If you want your scoped package to be publicly viewable (and installable)
# set --access=public. The only valid values for access are public and
# restricted. Unscoped packages always have an access level of public.
access=public
